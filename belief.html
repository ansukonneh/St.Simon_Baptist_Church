                <p>Our beliefs are rooted in the timeless truth of Scripture. As a Baptist congregation, we hold to historic Christian doctrines while remaining relevant to our modern context.</p>

                    <h3>The Bible</h3>
                    <p>We believe the Bible is the inspired, infallible, and authoritative Word of God. It is our supreme rule for faith and practice.</p>
                    <p class="scripture-ref">"All Scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness." - 2 Timothy 3:16</p>

                    <h3>The Trinity</h3>
                    <p>We believe in one God who exists eternally in three persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, equal in power and glory.</p>
                    <p class="scripture-ref">"Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit." - Matthew 28:19</p>

                    <h3>Jesus Christ</h3>
                    <p>We believe in the deity of Jesus Christ, His virgin birth, sinless life, atoning death, bodily resurrection, and imminent return.</p>
                    <p class="scripture-ref">"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God." - John 1:1</p>

                    <h3>Salvation</h3>
                    <p>We believe salvation is by grace alone through faith alone in Christ alone. It cannot be earned by good works.</p>
                    <p class="scripture-ref">"For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God." - Ephesians 2:8</p>

                    <p class="scripture-ref">"And he put all things under his feet and gave him as head over all things to the church, which is his body." - Ephesians 1:22-23</p>

                    <h4>Article 1: The Scriptures</h4>
                    <p>We believe the Holy Bible was written by men divinely inspired and is God's revelation of Himself to man. It has God for its author, salvation for its end, and truth, without any mixture of error, for its matter.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="statement-item">
                    <h4>Article 2: God</h4>
                    <p>We believe there is one and only one living and true God. The eternal God reveals Himself to us as Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, with distinct personal attributes, but without division of nature, essence, or being.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="statement-item">
                    <h4>Article 3: Man</h4>
                    <p>We believe man was created by the special act of God, in His own image, and is the crowning work of His creation. By his free choice man sinned against God and brought sin into the human race.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="statement-item">
                    <h4>Article 4: Salvation</h4>
                    <p>We believe salvation involves the redemption of the whole man and is offered freely to all who accept Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior. There is no salvation apart from personal faith in Jesus Christ as Lord.</p>

                <div class="statement-item">
                    <h4>Article 5: The Church</h4>
                    <p>We believe a New Testament church is a local body of baptized believers who are associated by covenant in the faith and fellowship of the gospel, observing the two ordinances of Christ, and exercising the gifts, rights, and privileges invested in them by His Word.</p>
